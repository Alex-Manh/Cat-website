                    <h2>Eating</h2>
                    <p> Cats are obligate carnivores, and do not do well on vegetarian diets. 
                        However, many cats may chew a little bit of grass 
                        to get rid of intestinal parasites.</p>
                    <p>Cats cannot taste sweets at all. 
                        They smell for food and taste amino acids instead. 
                        The digestive system of cats is not efficient for food with high sugar content
                        (candies, cookies) or even carbohydrates (rice, potato)</p>

                            A fraction of a teaspoon of water is taken up with each lap. 
                            Although some desert cats are able to obtain much of 
                            their water needs through the flesh of their prey,

                    <p>These behaviors are thought to be a way of marking territory.
                            Facial marking behavior is used to mark their territory as "safe". 
                            The cat rubs its cheeks on prominent objects in the preferred 
                            territory, depositing a chemical pheromone produced in glands 
                            in the cheeks. This is known as a contentment pheromone. 
                            Synthetic versions of the feline facial pheromone are available

                    <p>Cats carry these infantile behaviors beyond nursing and into adulthood. 
                            Some cats "nurse", i.e. suck, on clothing or bedding during kneading. 
                            The cat exerts firm downwards pressure with its paw, opening its toes 
                            to expose its claws, then closes its claws as it lifts its paw. 
                            The process takes place with alternate paws at intervals of one to 
                            two seconds. They may knead while sitting on their owner's lap, which
                            may prove painful if the cat has sharp claws. </p>

                    <h2>Panting</h2>
                    <p>Unlike dogs, panting is a rare occurrence in cats, except in warm weather 
                        environments. Some cats may pant in response to anxiety, fear or excitement. 
                        It can also be caused by play, exercise, or stress from things like car rides. 
                        However, if panting is excessive or the cat appears in distress, it may be 
                        a symptom of a more serious condition, such as a nasal blockage, 
                        heartworm disease, head trauma, or drug poisoning.
                    </p>

                    <p>In many cases, feline panting, especially if accompanied by other symptoms,
                        such as coughing or shallow breathing (dyspnea), is considered to be abnormal, 
                        and treated as a medical emergency.</p>

                    <h2>Body language</h2>
                    <p>Cats use body language vigorously to communicate. A cat may rub against an object, 
                        lick a person, and purr. Much of a cat's body language is through its tail, ears, 
                        ead position, and back posture. Cats flick their tails in an oscillating, snake-like
                         motion, or abruptly from side to side, often just before pouncing on an object or 
                         animal in what looks like "play" hunting behavior. If spoken to, a cat may flutter 
                         its tail in response, which may be the only indication of the interaction, though 
                         movement of its ears or head toward the source of the sound may be a better 
                         indication of the cat's awareness that a sound was made in their direction. 
                         When cats greet another cat in their vicinity, they can do a slow, languid, 
                         long blink to communicate affection if they trust the person or animal they are 
                         in contact with. It is a sign of trust.</p>

                         your cat from a human perspective is to say their name, and get their attention, 
                         and then look them the eyes and slowly blink at them to emulate trust and love, 
                         and they may return the gesture. </p>

                         Their postures can be friendly or aggressive, depending upon the situation. </p>

                    <h2>Colony organization</h2>
                    <p>Free-living domestic cats tend to form small to large colonies. Small colonies 
                        consist of one female, known as a queen, and her kittens. Large colonies consist 
                        of several queens and their kittens. Male cats are present in both types of colonies
                         and serve the purpose of reproduction and defending territory. Within these colonies 
                         altruistic behaviour occurs. This means that if an expecting queen helps another 
                         queen that just gave birth, then the helping queen will get help when she gives birth
                          in return. </p>

                            Although free living cats are found in colonies, stable social order, 
                            like that of the lion, does not exist. Free living cats usually are found in 
                            colonies for protection against predators, and food availability Although there
                             are many advantages of group living, such as easy access to mates, and defensive 
                             measures to protect food, there are also disadvantages, such as sexual competition 
                             for mates, and if the group becomes too big then fights may break out over food

                    <h2>Social learning</h2>
                    <p>Cats are observational learners. This type of learning emerges early in a cat's life, 
                        and has been shown in many laboratory studies. Young kittens learn to hunt from their 
                        mothers by observing their techniques when catching prey. The mother ensures their 
                        kittens learn hunting techniques by first bringing dead prey to the litter, then live 
                        prey. With the live prey, she demonstrates the techniques required for successful 
                        capture to her kittens. Once this is done, she then brings live prey to the litter 
                        for the kittens to catch themselves. Prey-catching behaviour of kittens improves over 
                        time when mothers are present over when they are not.</p>
                        <img src="images/chii-vol1-cover-2.png" alt="Mother cat taking care of her children">
                        <p>
                            Observational learning for cats can be described in terms of the drive to 
                            complete the behaviour, the cue that initiates the behaviour, the response 
                            to the cue, and the reward for completing the behaviour. This is shown above
                             when cats learn predatory behaviour from their mothers. The drive is hunger,
                              the cue is the prey, the response is to catch the prey, and the reward is to
                               relieve the hunger sensation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Kittens also show observational learning when they are socializing with humans.
                             They are more likely to initiate socialization with humans when their mothers
                              are exhibiting non-aggressive and non-defensive behaviours. 
                               Even though mothers spend most time with their kittens, male cats play
                                an important role by breaking up fights among litter mates. </p>
                        <p>
                            Observational learning is not limited to kitten-hood, it can also be
                             observed during adulthood. Studies have been done with adult cats performing
                              a task, such as pressing a lever after a visual cue. Adult cats that see others 
                              performing a task learn to perform the same task faster than those who did not
                               witness another cat.

                    <h2>Socialization and communication between cats and humans</h2>
                    <p>Cats have learned how to develop their vocals in order to converse with humans, 
                        in which they try to tell humans what they want. Cats vocalize to other cats.
                        Hisses and spits warn other cats to keep their distance; friendly cats may 
                        meow at each other in greeting or surprise. It may be noted that a "hiss" 
                        is less about the sound and more about the showing of teeth along with their 
                        stance. Kittens also meow at their mothers for milk and attention, 
                        but this may go away once they have no need for milk as they become adults 
                        if they are not actively socialized. Another way that cats and humans interact 
                        is through what people call "head bunting" in which a cat rubs its head on a 
                        human in order to leave their scent, mark to claim territory, and create a bond.

                        <h2>Dominance</h2>
                        <p>Dominance can be seen among cats in multi-cat households. It can be seen
                             when other cats submit to the "dominant" cat. Dominance includes such
                              behaviours as walking around the dominant cat, waiting for the dominant 
                              cat to walk past, avoiding eye contact, crouching, laying on their side 
                              (defensive posture), and retreating when the dominant cat approaches. 
                            
                              <img src="images/JI-vol1-p53.png" alt="Cat biting human hands">

                              Dominant cats present a specific body posture as well. The cat displays
                               ears straight up, the base of its tail will be arched, and it looks directly 
                               at subordinate cats. These dominant cats are usually not aggressive, but if a
                                subordinate cat blocks food they may become aggressive. When this aggressive
                                 behaviour occurs it could also lead to the dominant cat preventing subordinate 
                                 cats from eating and using the litter box. This can cause the subordinate
                                  cat to defecate somewhere else and create problems with human interaction.</p>

                    <h2>Groom</h2>
        
                    <p>Oral grooming for domestic and feral cats is a common behavior; 
                            recent studies on domestic cats show that they spend about 8% of 
                            resting time grooming themselves. Grooming is extremely important 
                            not only to clean themselves but also to ensure ectoparasite control.
                            Fleas tend to be the most common ectoparasite of cats and some studies 
                            allude to indirect evidence that grooming in cats is effective in 
                            removing fleas. Cats not only use their tongue for grooming to control
                            ectoparasites but scratch grooming as well may aid in dislodging fleas 
                            from the head and neck.</p>
